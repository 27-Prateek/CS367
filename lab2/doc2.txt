Artificial intelligence is transforming the modern world completely. Machine learning algorithms can analyze vast amounts of information efficiently. Deep learning networks are modeled after the human brain structure. Natural language processing helps computers to understand human language. Computer vision enables machines to interpret visual data accurately. Robotics merges AI with mechanical engineering to build autonomous systems. Data science focuses on extracting insights from complex datasets. Neural networks need extensive training on labeled datasets. Supervised learning utilizes input-output pairs for model training. Unsupervised learning finds hidden patterns in unlabeled information.
