Artificial intelligence is revolutionizing the modern world. Machine learning algorithms can process vast amounts of data efficiently. Deep learning networks are inspired by the human brain structure. Natural language processing enables computers to understand human speech. Computer vision allows machines to interpret visual information. Robotics combines AI with mechanical engineering to create autonomous systems. Data science involves extracting insights from complex datasets. Neural networks require extensive training on labeled data. Supervised learning uses input-output pairs for model training. Unsupervised learning discovers hidden patterns in unlabeled data.
